<p>Hello. This is my blog. My name is Ray and I live and work in Toronto. </p>

<p>This blog is hosted on Github and is written using <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>The choice of Jekyll and Github owes a lot to an <a href="http://openmymind.net/2011/10/11/This-Blog-Is-Now-Hosted-On-Github/" target="_blank">article</a> written by Karl Seguin. He maintains an excellent <a href="http://openmymind.net/" target="_blank">blog</a> and I share his preference for minimalism.</p>

<p>The choice of <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> owes much to Simon Hørup Eskildsen, who used it to simply and effectively style his own Jekyll <a href="http://sirupsen.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>. I've been using Twitter Bootstrap lately, but it is overkill for something as simple as this blog.</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/raymondfallon" target="_blank">worked</a> in the software business for many years, primarily as a developer and a leader of teams and direction. I have plenty of opinions and experience to write of, so it’s about time I did something about it. Not many people share my sense of humour, so I make no warranties that you will enjoy my ramblings. That is assuming that anybody even notices this exists.</p>

<p>I like cats but there will be no pictures posted here.</p>

<p>Ray.</p>
