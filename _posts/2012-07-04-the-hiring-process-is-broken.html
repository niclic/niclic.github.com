<p class="article-title">{{ page.title }}</p>

<p>I believe the hiring process is broken and needs fixing, so I want to write a series of posts on the subject. Although the articles may deal specifically with the hiring of software people, I believe the content may be relevant to other fields.</p>

<p>Some topics I want to write about:<br><br>
1. Resumes are redundant.<br>
2. Job adverts are pointless and counterproductive.<br>
3. Years of experience is overrated.<br>
4. People should screen candidates - just not HR.<br>
5. What exactly is the point of the interview?<br>
</p>

<p>And perhaps more.</p>

<p>Soon...</p>
