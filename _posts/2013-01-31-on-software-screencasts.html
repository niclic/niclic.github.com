<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Screencasts have become an essential tool of the conscientious Software Developer. Prior to the screencast, we read books or attended training courses (if we could afford to). Most Software Developers never get the chance to learn from somebody who really knows and enjoys their work. If you did, then count yourself lucky. In a way, screencasts can help fill the void left by the absence of a mentor to guide us along the way to mastery.</p>

<p>This is not an in-depth review or rating of any particular service, but rather my personal reflections of those I have enjoyed.  I've purchased screencasts mostly from PeepCode and TekPub, but there are new offerings coming online all the time and I'll briefly mention some of them at the end. I don't personally know any of the people behind these ventures and I'm not being compensated for endorsing them. Their work is excellent and deserves your attention.</p>

<h5>The Beginning</h5>
<p>Any discussion on screencasts should probably start with Dot .NET Rocks TV (dnrTV), which, having come online in 2006, makes it the granddaddy of Software Development screencasts.<a href="#ref-one"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I do recall watching some MSDN webcasts prior to 2006, but I have almost no memory of their content or usefulness. To be honest, I never watched many episodes of dnrTV, except for a few with J P Boodhoo in 2007. I was more interested in the new wave of ALT.NET, which rarely featured on the relatively staid dnrTV at the time. </p>

<h5>From MVC Storefront to TekPub</h5>
<p>Although PeepCode and RailsCasts predate TekPub, I wasn't big into Ruby or Rails when they started (2006-2007). I was a .NET guy, and around this time the .NET community was facing a quasi-paradigm shift with the introduction of new ideas from a group of people who went by the name of ALT.NET. New ideas flooded into the .NET world: TDD, Refactoring, Patterns, DDD, ORM, IoC, Continuous Integration, MVC, and so on. It was a long way from ASP.NET Web Forms and DataReaders, but an exciting and challenging time to be a .NET Developer. One of the first .NET screencasts I remember watching was a one-off by Evan Hoff in which he worked a coding problem in TDD style.<a href="#ref-two"><sup>[2]</sup></a> There were plenty of blog posts on TDD, but to see somebody else work through a problem was refreshing and a great learning experience. </p>

<p>Old school Microsoft Developers faced a challenge to keep up with this new wave of ideas. One of them, Rob Conery, did something that I've admired to this day. Rob worked for Microsoft and decided he was going to explore this new world and share his experience through a series of screencasts. Published in 2008, MVC storefront <a href="#ref-three"><sup>[3]</sup></a> was a landmark series for several reasons. Most importantly it ran for 13 episodes, which was unheard of. The productions involved discussions with many of the leaders of ALT.NET, including: Ayende Rahien, Jeremy Miller, Scott Bellware, and David Laribee, among others. I hate name dropping, but their participation was a major part of what made the series great. Rob would write some code and have these guys tear it apart while you watched. He took the rap so you didn't have to. It was a very inspiring series. Rob went on to found TekPub with James Avery and continues to put out great work for both .NET and Ruby developers.<a href="#ref-four"><sup>[4]</sup></a> I respect Rob's no-nonsense style and honesty. I think TekPub's standout production is the 26-episode series Mastering C# with Jon Skeet. </p>

<h5>PeepCode</h5>
<p>PeepCode has been around since late 2006.<a href="#ref-five"><sup>[5]</sup></a> I started using PeepCode in 2009 when I decided I wanted to explore the world of Ruby, Rails, and the Command Line. PeepCode screencasts are beautifully produced and packed with information. I enjoy hearing Geoffrey Grosenbach announce the start of each screencast with "It's Peep-Coooode!"</p>

<p>A recent trend pioneered by PeepCode is screencasts that focus on individuals rather than particular technologies or tools. PeepCode calls these productions Play by Play (TekPub calls them Full Throttle). Play by Play shows an expert working through a problem in (near) real-time. I was amazed to see the efficiency with which these people worked. To see somebody totally own their code environment was a real eye opener (watch the episodes with John Barnette or Zed Shaw to see what I mean). Experts know their tools. If you master one thing other than a programming language, make sure it's the editor you write that language in.</p>

<h5>RailsCasts</h5>
<p>RailsCasts has been around since 2007.<a href="#ref-six"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Each episode is relatively short, but RailsCasts makes up for that by covering a vast number of topics - there are over 400 episodes! I find RailsCasts indispensable for learning the myriad tools available to the Rails Developer. This variety of options can be intimidating if you are new to Rails development. My advice is to go to RailsCasts and search for a particular concept or tool. After 15 minutes or so, you will have all the information you need to get started.</p>

<h5>Rails Tutorial</h5>
<p>The pinnacle of screencast achievement must be Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial.<a href="#ref-seven"><sup>[7]</sup></a> With over 18 hours of video, it's an incredible accomplishment. All that time gives Michael the chance to really dig deep into the subject. The sample application may look trivial, but it's not. It's actually no less complex that most of the applications we are tasked with building (but may not want to admit it). I learned so much from watching this series. In particular, I find this to be the best display of TDD I have seen so far. </p>

<h5>Clean Coders</h5>
<p>Uncle Bob has also got into the Screencast game, tansferring his excelent Clean Code book to a series of highly entertaining videos.<a href="#ref-eight"><sup>[8]</sup></a> If you have ever seen Uncle Bob give a talk, you know he has a very original style of communicating ideas. I've watched the first four episodes and it's safe to say that the Clean Code series is like nothing else out there. Clean Coders has also just releaesed the first episode in a new series called Build an App With Corey Haines. Corey is a very engaging host and I am looking forward to seeing this series develop.</p>

<h5>Others</h5>
<p>There are several other producers of screencasts, many of which I have yet to sample, such as: Destroy All Software <a href="#ref-nine"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, Pluralsight <a href="#ref-ten"><sup>[10]</sup></a>, and Dimecasts <a href="#ref-eleven"><sup>[11]</sup></a>. Pluralsight began putting their course content online starting in 2009 (courses, screencasts, whatever). Dimecasts actually started in 2008 and follows a similar format to RailsCasts, focussing on .NET programming and tools.  I recently started watching Tuts+ Premium, which focuses on Web Development and front-end technologies.<a href="#ref-twelve"><sup>[12]</sup></a> I've only watched the free series on Sublime Text and jQuery, but I find their content engaging, especially the delivery of Jeffrey Way, and I intend to subscribe. I like that their screencasts (or courses) are broken-down into short videos, allowing you to watch a few episodes at a time and then come back later. With a single episode you have to remember where you stopped if you can't watch all the way to the end.</p>

<h5>Wrap</h5>
<p>I like to hear all opinions and see all styles of development, so I'll continue to purchase screencasts from whoever produces them. They are a great way to learn. If you are a Developer you owe it to yourself to check them out. If you are a Team Lead, you should look into purchasing screencasts for your team - it's a good way to introduce new concepts and tools in an engaging way. Let me know if you have any particular screencast favourites or know of any series that I should check out.</p>
